# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would start by updating the Add and Edit Song views to incorporate separate forms for different types of song metaData, and eventually expand into fully Released Recording Data. 

I would also like to include a capability to record audio into the app using the Audio Recorder Module for Node.js. Currrently, I have incorporated audio upload via Cloudinary for the audio feature. 

Lastly, I would like to add a 'public' and 'private' view for each Song, and add a secondary authenication method using the passport-local stategy. 


# Lessons Learned:

 My biggest challenge was incorporating audio upload with Cloudinary. Once I learned how the data was being taken in, how to setup the controller to listen to the request, and how to incorporate enctype form-data for my form, I had it working wonderfully.
