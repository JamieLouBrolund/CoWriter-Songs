   - Used to save cookie in database that allowed for user's session to persist.
* dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
   - Intergration of .env file that allows protection and processing of environment variables.
* express-session (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
   - Middleware that aids formating of user session cookie data. Used in cooperation with 'connect-mongo' to store the session in the database.
* path (https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)
   - provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
* mongoose (https://mongoosejs.com/)
   - Schema-based solution to model application data. Used to validate/organize database user and story entries.
* morgan (https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
   - Node. js and Express middleware to log HTTP requests and errors. Used to simply process of testing/troubleshooting during development.
* passport (https://www.passportjs.org/)
   - Authentication middleware for Node.js. Used to modularize the authentication process with OAuth and Google login.
* passport-google-oauth20 (https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-google-oauth2/)

# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would start by updating the Add and Edit Song views to incorporate separate forms for different types of song metaData, and eventually expand into fully Released Recording Data. 

I would also like to include a capability to record audio into the app using the Audio Recorder Module for Node.js. Currrently, I have incorporated audio upload via Cloudinary for the audio feature. 

Lastly, I would like to add a 'public' and 'private' view for each Song, and add a secondary authenication method using the passport-local stategy. 


# Lessons Learned:

 My biggest challenge was incorporating audio upload with Cloudinary. Once I learned how the data was being taken in, how to setup the controller to listen to the request, and how to incorporate enctype form-data for my form, I had it working wonderfully.

# How to Get it Working:

Add a .env file in the config folder with these values:
* PORT = 2121 //or whatever you choose
* MONGO_URI =  //MongoDB connection string
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = // Google Auth ID
* GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = // Google Auth secret
* CLOUD_NAME = // Cloudinary Cloud Name
* API_KEY = // Cloudinary key
* API_SECRET = // Cloudinary Secret

PORT = 2222

MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://jamielou222:Marley19trutH@cluster0.4t87i3h.mongodb.net/cowriter?retryWrites=true&w=majority

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 804512378221-j5l0umu9h7k587gf5snhouf3j6umqfrd.apps.googleusercontent.com

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = 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

CLOUD_NAME = dvu70r9b5

API_KEY = 874639256965294

API_SECRET = udwt1sX3c45S9vscmlGrbsPBhsA
